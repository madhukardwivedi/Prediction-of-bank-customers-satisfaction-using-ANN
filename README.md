# Prediction-of-bank-customer-s-satisfaction-using-ANN
In this use case, I have used bank data from Kaggle. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset by performing feature selection, categorical variable handing, feature scaling using standard scalar, etc.

After performing EDA, I have used deep learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to build the classifier. In the classifier, I have performed hyperparameter tuning using Kerasclassifier and GridSearchCv. Eventually, I got the best parameters which resulted in 86.66% accuracy for the training dataset and 85.55% in the test dataset.
